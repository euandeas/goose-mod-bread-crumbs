# BreadCrumbs Mod For Desktop Goose
**About**:

This is a simple mod for [Samperson's Desktop Goose](https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose) which allows you to feed the goose to make   him walk across your screen, or to calm him down when he is in a frenzy. Plus he makes cute nom sound.

**Usage**:

The default button is 'RightShiftButton', however this can be changed in the Config.txt using the codes from: 'https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.keys?view=netframework-4.8'

**Changing Crumbs**: 

You can change the image used for the crumbs by renaming a different .png to "crumbs.png" and putting it inside the BreadCrumbs folder. Avoid half-transparent pixels as this will     cause an orange line to form around your image.

Honk!
